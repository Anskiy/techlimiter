Discord:

A program made to generate self imposed challenges, Tech Limiter is a simple project. It was inspired by the Four Job Fiesta for FF5 and the Esper Allocator for FF6.

How it works:

When run, the Limiter spits out two text files. They contain the techs each character is permitted to use, as well as a list of available dual and triple techs. The challenge consists of beating the game using only these techs.

Usage:

Windows users can just run the .exe file. Mac and Linux users should run techlimiter.py in the sourcefiles folder. Running it with Python 3 is recommended.
